The main goal of this research work is to make an Intelligent based Traffic Routing that deals with the automatization of the traffic monitoring techniques for collection of various of traffic based information basically comprising traffic delay, cost of travel , average speed etc as well as analytical processing of the data and visualization of results obtained.

This is a mobile application developed on JAVA. It provides a user interface to get the minimum distance from users' entered source, destination and time of travel.

A complete discussion on the mechanism behind the data gathering using GPS based technologies has been made in our research as well as a small account on the Floyd and Warshall algorithm and android based mobile technology has been also given. To demonstrate the validation and applicability of the end application the proposed methodology has been implemented in an input set obtained from the Delhi traffic authority and feeding them to a neural network model for observation of trend analysis using feed forward network fused with fast back propagation learning model and preparing a output result set, In our research we would also check the validity of the result obtained using regression plot and various other statistical tools.
